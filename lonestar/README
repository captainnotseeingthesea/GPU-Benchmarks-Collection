LonestarGPU
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LonestarGPU is a collection of widely-used real-world applications that exhibit
irregular behavior.
This work is done in collaboration with Texas State University, San Marcos, USA
Requirements

    NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 2.0 or above
    CUDA 4.0 or above
    A modern Linux distribution

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compilation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tar xvzf lonestargpu-1.02.tar.gz
cd lonestargpu-1.02/
make
make inputs

This should make all the benchmarks in the suite and download sample inputs. If
an individual benchmark is to be compiled, go to the appropriate benchmark
directory in apps/ and run make. For compilation, nvcc should be in the path.
Running benchmarks

The compiled binaries are by default stored in bin/ directory. Invoke the
appropriate application with command-lines specified as per individual benchmark
description. The command make inputs creates a directory inputs/. Various input
formats for the benchmarks are listed below.

    BFS, MST, SSSP: .gr binary files
    DMR: mesh files of the form .poly, .node and .ele
    PTA: requires four kinds of text files
    BH, SP: no input file necessary; input is generated randomly
